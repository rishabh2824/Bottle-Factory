# Bottle-Factory
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency with the queue data structure. I have simulated the working of a bottle factory. There is a driver class which takes in empty bottles and produces filled & capped utilizing four queues - production, supply, filling and capping). 
In addition, I have implement two variants of the queue data structure (linked and circular) and a queue iterator.
